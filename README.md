### Hi, I'm Cassidy! ðŸ‘‹

Things that I do to calm myself:

* Cook. My most falling-apart cookbook is Smoke and Pickles by Edward Lee.
* Watch ASMR videos. [FredsVoice ASMR](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YDVivhPsOEuyl1-WwLA-w) is my favorite.
* Read graphic novels.  I like cute and wholesome queer romance like Bloom, Mooncakes, Heartstopper...
* Listen to music. 
* Make art.  I'm ok at drawing, a sloppy guitar player, and the worst poet.
